# AI output rules
- Roadmap generation must return STRICT JSON only.
- Validate JSON with Zod. If invalid, retry with a correction prompt.
- Store the validated JSON and extracted rows (phases/steps/resources).
- Store metadata: model, version, created_at.

# No content bloat
- Prefer 1 to 2 resources per step.
- Keep steps actionable with estimated hours.
