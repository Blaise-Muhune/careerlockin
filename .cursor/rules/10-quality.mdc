# Workflow
- Start each task with a 3 to 7 bullet plan, then execute.
- Make changes in small verifiable steps.
- After each step, ensure the app still runs.

# Must pass
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- If tests exist: `pnpm test`

# Code quality
- No `any` unless unavoidable, explain inline.
- Validate user input with Zod on the server.
- Add loading + error states for async UI.
